Model Architecture
The Lost and Found project is designed to detect objects in images using a deep learning approach. This system can be applied in airports, railway stations, schools, and other public places where lost and found services are essential. The system classifies objects into different categories, helping to automate the process of finding lost items.

Installation-
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/rishabhGit24/Lost-and-Found-.git
cd Lost-and-Found-

Dataset:
The dataset for this project consists of images of various objects that are commonly found in lost and found departments (e.g., wallets, bags, keys, phones, etc.). You can either create your own dataset or use publicly available datasets related to object detection.

Model Architecture:
The model architecture uses a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The CNN is designed to extract features from the images and categorize them into predefined object classes.
